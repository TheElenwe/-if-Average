# -if-Average  The exercise is almost identical to a previous exercise with a minor change. It's the end of the semester and you got your marks from, Geometry, Algebra, Physics classes. If the average score is 7 and above print "Good job!", if the average score is between 6 and 4 print "You need to work harder!", if the average score is below 4 print "Failed, you really need to work harder!".

Create a program that:

Reads the values of these 3 lessons
Calculate the average of your grades
Example: Geometry = 6, Algebra = 7, Physics = 8
Output: Your average score is 7, Good job!"
